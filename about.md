## Profession

I am a software developer with a background in low-level programming and
efficient, real-time data processing. I have strong skills in digital signal
processing, and a special interest in applying those skills to audio signals.

## Education

I have a BS and an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie
Mellon. I have a breadth of general knowledge in analog and digital electronics
design, and a deep concentration in signal processing and machine learning.
During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on [many interesting
projects](/projects) in these fields.

## Hobbies

In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal coding projects, contributing to
open source software, and practicing my skills as a recording musician.

My personal projects often relate to audio software. While at CMU, I developed
an audio processing framework called ClickTrack. I am currently maintaining
a similar framework in Rust, called oxcable. The framework is open-source, and
publicly available on Rust's package manager, [crates.io](http://crates.io).

As a musician, I play clarinet, saxophone, and guitar. I produce in [Logic Pro
X](http://www.apple.com/logic-pro), and have released some of my works on [my
SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/thesilentorchestra).
